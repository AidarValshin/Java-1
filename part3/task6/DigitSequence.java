//In this exercise, you will try out what happens when a method is added to an
//interface. In Java 7, implement a class DigitSequence that implements
//Iterator<Integer>, not IntSequence. Provide methods hasNext, next,
//and a do-nothing remove. Write a program that prints the elements of an instance.
//In Java 8, the Iterator class gained another method, forEachRemaining.
//Does your code still compile when you switch to Java 8? If you put your Java 7 class
//in a JAR file and donâ€™t recompile, does it work in Java 8? What if you call the
//forEachRemaining method? Also, the remove method has become a default
//method in Java 8, throwing an UnsupportedOperationException. What
//happens when remove is called on an instance of your class?
